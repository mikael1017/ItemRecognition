## For the final project, I want to extend the AR project so that it detects the faces of people and it will apply a 3d filter on the face. I haven’t decided what kind of filters to implement, I’m thinking about creating characters or creating an object according to the position of the person’s face. On top of this I also applied a background filter where it changes the background of the video to the specified background image of my choice
